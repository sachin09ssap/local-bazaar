An online platform for local shop owners to sell and local buyers to buy the products

#### description
In the time of Pandemic where long term lockdown is imposed on us and the spread of the virus, its difficult to avail basic needs such as medicine,vegetables and rations for customers and also to sell the stocks present with the vendors.
Our aim is to provide an online platform within a city(Local) for sellers and customers so that sitting safely at their homes they can interact with each other without actually meeting so that customers can buy such essentials without fear of getting infected or spreading the virus.
This will reduce even the slightest chance of casual interaction among the people and also help the local market to be functional with the help of our platform even in the lockdown.
